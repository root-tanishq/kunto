## Script Developing Guide

If you want to create an script for kunto , Please create a bash file with all the installation commands required by the tool for any command which needs to be executed please use `${SMK_SUDO}` instead of sudo

- for python version , please use the below code for solving issues regarding python version and binary name issues
```bash
function tool_install() {
${SMK_SUDO} ${PYTHON_PATH} <python command>
}
if [[ -e $(which python) && $(python --version | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F'.' '{print $1}') = "3" && -e $(which pip) ]];then
  export PYTHON_PATH=$(which python);
  tool_install
elif [[ -e $(which python3) && $(python3 --version | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F'.' '{print $1}') = "3" && -e $(which pip3) ]];then
  export PYTHON_PATH=$(which python3);
  tool_install
else
  ${SMK_SUDO} apt install python python-pip -y
  ${SMK_SUDO} apt install python3 python3-pip -y
  if [[ -e $(which python) && $(python --version | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F'.' '{print $1}') = "3" && -e $(which pip) ]];then
    export PYTHON_PATH=$(which python);
    tool_install
  elif [[ -e $(which python3) && $(python3 --version | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F'.' '{print $1}') = "3" && -e $(which pip3) ]];then
    export PYTHON_PATH=$(which python3);
    tool_install

  fi
